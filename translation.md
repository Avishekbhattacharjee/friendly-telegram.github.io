# Translations

Friendly-Telegram supports translation of most [strings](https://techterms.com/definition/string "definition"). Currently, there is not a very easy way to make translations packs, but it is possible. This is a guide on how to do so.

1. Set up locally
   You can't create a translation pack if you are using Heroku. This is due to restrictions placed on apps by Heroku itself, and is not fixable, nor a bug. 

   You can read more on local setup in [the docs](/installing "Installation")
2. Open the web interface
   On whatever device is hosting the userbot, visit [this link](http://localhost:8080). It will open the friendly-telegram sign-in page.
